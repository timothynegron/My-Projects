# `Timothy Negron's Portfolio`

### `About Me`

Hello World, my name is Timothy Negron. I love to write code.
I was born and raised in the Bronx, NY. I joined the U.S. Army
after High School and served for over 6 years. During my service,
I deployed to Afghanistan twice in support of Operation Enduring Freedom
and earned the rank of Sergeant. After the Army, I pursued a 
Bachelor of Science in Computer Programming and Information Systems. I graduated with Honor's and then earned a Cisco Certified Network Associate Routing and Switching certification.
I'm now focusing on creating projects so that I can increase my
skill level as a coder and learn about new technologies.
