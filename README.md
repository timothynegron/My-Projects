# `Timothy Negron - Projects`

## `About Me`

Hello, my name is Timothy Negron. I love to write code. I was born and raised in the Bronx, NY. I joined the U.S. Army after High School and served for over 6 years. During my service, I deployed to Afghanistan twice in support of Operation Enduring Freedom
and earned the rank of Sergeant. After the Army, I pursued a  Bachelor of Science in Computer Programming and Information Systems. I graduated with Honor's and then earned a Cisco Certified Network Associate Routing and Switching certification. I'm now focusing on creating projects so that I can increase my skill level as a coder and learn about new technologies.
